# Blazor in the Enterprise

This is a complement to my talk _"Blazor in the Enterprise"_ that I gave on
September 12, 2022, in the context of [Programmers' Week
2022](https://web.cvent.com/event/a28ac49b-d141-46a6-831d-74db2b0997c4/summary).

The solution I present here, `ProgrammersWeek.TalkManager`, is a dual Blazor
Server/Blazor WebAssembly app that fosters an implementation that is easy to
understand, flexible, maintainable, and secure, among other tenets that are
expected of any piece of software that aims to satisfy the needs of any
organization.
